### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was where it all started. What I really liked about this lab is that it exposed us to github and terminal commands. Even though I have had experience coding in the past, I have never used terminal commands like, clang++, ls, cd, etc. 

* Lab 7 

    Lab 7 part 2 was probably my favorite this semester. Completing the blackjack functions was kind of tricky, but once I figured it out, it was really fulfilling. Also I've never learned how to play blackjack so this lab kind of taught me the basics. 

* Lab 10 

    Lab 10 part 2 is also a favorite of mine. It was a very challenging lab for my partner and I, we were exposed to 2D arrays that contained strings for the very first time. After some time, we were able to figure out the problem and complete the lab. It was a very satisfying feeling.
